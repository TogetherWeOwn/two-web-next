## Thinking Path

<!--
Walk from the system down to this change, one short bullet per step, like this:
- This repo holds the operator tooling that mints credentials and provisions agents.
- The sibling guard stops two runs from building the same card.
- It misses a sibling that has pushed nothing yet.
- This PR adds a control-plane check for that case.
- The benefit is one implementation per card, not two.

## What Changed

<!-- List the changes. Name each file or script that matters, and say what it does now. -->

-

## Verification

<!--
Give the exact commands you ran and their results. Say what you did not run, and why.
Never claim a green run you did not see. For a bug fix, show the test that fails without the fix.
-->

-

## Risks

<!--
What can this break? Name credentials, permissions, hosts, or agents it touches.
Name the rollback. Write "None" only if you checked.
-->

-

## Model Used

<!--
Name the provider and the exact model ID, plus the mode (reasoning effort, tool use) if it matters.
If a human wrote every line, write: None — human-authored.
