# Production Kit cutover: delivered slice

This page records only what is delivered. The production deploy still builds and
uploads the Hono Worker; nothing in `deploy-production.yml` uploads the Kit
build yet.

## Delivered

- `deploy-production.yml` has a `kit_route_family` dispatch input (`hono`,
  `archive`, `archive-static`; default `hono`). Schedule and `workflow_run`
  promotions always use `hono`. Preflight validates the value with
  `ci/kit-route-flags.mjs` and exposes `kit_route_family`, `kit_archive` and
  `kit_static` as job outputs. No step consumes them, so the input changes
  nothing that deploys.
- `rollback-production.yml` takes `dry_run` (default `false`, also on
  `workflow_call`). A dry run keeps the environment, gate, version id,
  credential, live-version guard and target-secret checks, prints what a real
  run would do, and stops: no `wrangler rollback`, no smoke, no dead-letter
  capture, no notification, no versions deploy, no migration. It still waits for
  the `production` Environment approval because the checks need production
  credentials.
- `test/kit-production-operations.test.ts` pins these source facts, with no
  runtime claim: `web/wrangler.production.jsonc` only produces to the two
  production queues and declares no consumers and no crons; the root
  `wrangler.jsonc` still points at the Hono entry `src/worker.ts`, which exports
  `fetch`, `queue` and `scheduled`, and its production env is produce-only;
  `wrangler.jobs.jsonc` `env.production` (`two-web-jobs-production`) is a
  separate Worker with no routes that consumes those same queues and owns both
  crons; the production Tail `ALERT_ROUTES` equals the Hono route inventory
  (no Kit route ids), and `/about`, `/faq` and `/rules` keep the same Hono route
  label whether served directly or through the Hono catch-all dispatch.

- The production Kit config enters through `web/worker.js`, which delegates
  once to the unchanged adapter-generated Worker, then runs
  `protectKitWorkerResponse`. Kit can render its fatal `error.html` or rebuild a
  response after the hook has returned. This outer boundary restores missing
  security headers without retrying the request. Complete Hono, Kit and asset
  envelopes pass through unchanged, including their CSP, cache policy, cookies
  and renderer label. Incomplete responses get the shared path/method policy,
  no-store, origin/renderer labels and a safe request id; HTML errors carrying
  the exact existing fallback style receive its existing hash allowlist. The
  template, style bytes and allowlist are unchanged. Synthetic regression cases
  and an Actions built-Worker fatal fixture are verification sources, not a
  recorded PASS or independent Security approval.

- Actions rehearses the production-config Kit `versions upload` with `--dry-run`
  and `--no-bundle`, then requires its output Worker to equal the dry-run build
  byte for byte. The build metafile and both output directories are retained for
  14 days, keyed by source SHA, run and attempt. This is build-only evidence, not
  an upload/deployment receipt or a non-expiring rollback pointer. The new
  `ci/kit-upload-rehearsal.mjs` receipt binds the compared Worker bytes, metafile,
  complete adapter asset-build tree (including control files), production config,
  wrapper and both lockfiles to the source SHA, run and attempt. It rejects missing
  required build files, empty or changed Worker bytes and symlinked tree entries.
  This tree is not Wrangler's uploaded-asset selection; no version identity or
  package-absence eligibility is claimed. The existing Hono inventory, upload and
  deployed receipts remain unchanged. Receipt generation and its negative-control
  tests are wired into Actions; a result has not yet been observed.

## Unimplemented

- Production Kit upload (`web/wrangler.production.jsonc` as a version of the
  existing script, with the web build and dependency install).
- A fail-closed, verified pure-Hono version pointer retained across Kit deploys.
  A version with no marker must not be classified as pure Hono.
- Same-byte bundle evidence receipts for the Kit upload. The existing Hono
  bundle inventory, upload and deployed receipts are unchanged.

## Status

Full branch-dispatch Actions verification has been requested; no runtime,
parity or upload-rehearsal PASS is recorded here. No staging or production
workflow or rollback drill has run for this change.
